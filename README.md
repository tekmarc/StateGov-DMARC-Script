# StateGov-DMARC-Script
This script evaluates the DMARC policies of all the organizational State Government .gov TLD domains. (Specifically, based off the .gov domains here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.gov#Use_by_states_and_territories ) This script also includes the state.stateabbrv.us domains.

It does not validate syntax currently, however, so keep that in mind. It is only looking at policy strings.
